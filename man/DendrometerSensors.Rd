\description{
Dendrometers are measurement devices that continuously monitor size variation in plant organs like stems, branches and fruits. 
Data from dendrometers can be used for monitoring plantsâ€™ daily water status and accordingly make automated irrigation decisions.
The dataset includes data of 100 sensors from 120 hourly readings (5 days).
